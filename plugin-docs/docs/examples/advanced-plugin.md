# Advanced Plugin Example

This document showcases a more complex plugin example, demonstrating advanced features and techniques that can be utilized in plugin development.

## Overview

The advanced plugin example illustrates how to implement features such as asynchronous processing, event handling, and interaction with external APIs. This example is designed for developers who are familiar with the basics of plugin development and are looking to enhance their skills.

## Plugin Structure

The advanced plugin consists of the following components:

- **Main Plugin File**: The entry point for the plugin, where the main logic is implemented.
- **Event Handlers**: Functions that respond to specific events triggered within the environment.
- **API Integration**: Code that interacts with external services or APIs to extend the plugin's functionality.

## Example Code

```python
import asyncio
import requests
from plugin_framework import Plugin, Listener, Actions

class AdvancedPlugin(Plugin):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.api_url = "https://api.example.com/data"

    @Listener.reg
    async def on_message(self, event, actions: Actions):
        user_message = str(event.message)
        
        if user_message.startswith("!fetch"):
            await self.fetch_data(event, actions)

    async def fetch_data(self, event, actions: Actions):
        response = await self.async_request(self.api_url)
        if response:
            await actions.send(group_id=event.group_id, message=f"Data fetched: {response}")
        else:
            await actions.send(group_id=event.group_id, message="Failed to fetch data.")

    async def async_request(self, url):
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        response = await loop.run_in_executor(None, requests.get, url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        return None

# Plugin registration
plugin = AdvancedPlugin()
```

## Features Demonstrated

- **Asynchronous Processing**: The plugin uses `asyncio` to handle asynchronous requests, allowing for non-blocking operations.
- **Event Handling**: The plugin listens for messages and responds based on user input.
- **API Integration**: The plugin fetches data from an external API and processes the response.

## Conclusion

This advanced plugin example serves as a guide for developers looking to implement more complex functionalities in their plugins. By leveraging asynchronous programming and external APIs, developers can create powerful and responsive plugins that enhance user experience.
