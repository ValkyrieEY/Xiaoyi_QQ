# Basic Plugin Example

This document provides an example of a simple plugin, explaining its structure and functionality.

## Overview

The basic plugin is designed to demonstrate the fundamental components required for a plugin to function within the system. It includes event handling and message processing capabilities.

## Plugin Structure

A typical plugin consists of the following components:

- **Plugin Manifest**: A file that contains metadata about the plugin, such as its name, version, and description.
- **Event Handlers**: Functions that respond to specific events triggered within the system.
- **Message Processing**: Logic to handle incoming messages and generate appropriate responses.

## Example Code

Here is a simple implementation of a basic plugin:

```python
# basic_plugin.py

class BasicPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Basic Plugin"
        self.version = "1.0"
        self.description = "A simple plugin to demonstrate basic functionality."

    def on_message(self, event, actions):
        user_message = str(event.message)
        if "hello" in user_message.lower():
            response = "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
            actions.send(event.group_id, response)

# Register the plugin
plugin = BasicPlugin()
```

## Functionality

- **Initialization**: The plugin initializes with a name, version, and description.
- **Message Handling**: It listens for messages and responds with a greeting if the message contains the word "hello".

## Conclusion

This basic plugin serves as a foundation for developers to build upon. By understanding its structure and functionality, you can create more complex plugins tailored to your needs.
