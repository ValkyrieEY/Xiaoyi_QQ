# Installation Instructions for Plugin Development

## Prerequisites

Before you start developing plugins, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pip**: Pip is the package installer for Python. It usually comes pre-installed with Python. You can check if it's installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

3. **Git**: Git is required for version control. You can download it from the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the plugin development repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plugin-docs.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the cloned repository:
   ```bash
   cd plugin-docs
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**: To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can run a simple test command or script provided in the `samples` directory.

## Additional Tools

- **IDE/Text Editor**: It is recommended to use an IDE or text editor that supports Python development, such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.

- **Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the documentation provided in the `docs` directory to understand the plugin structure and development guidelines.
